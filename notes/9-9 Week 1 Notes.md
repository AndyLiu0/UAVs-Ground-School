#### 1. What software is on our current drone?

- Object Detection
	- Switched from OpenCV to YOLO, might be switching back?
- Cube Orange runs Ardupilot, WiFi to MavLink
#### 2. What kinds of challenges/projects can YOU work on as a Software team member?

- Flight controller improvements with RL?
- Computer vision
	- image stitching
	- better object detection
- 3D mapping for environmental research
- OpenDroneMap not fully integrated yet
#### 3. What's the "industry standard" for drone software in 2025?

- Flight software: Ardupilot/Betaflight -> PX4
- Autonomy: YOLO -> SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping), pathplanning
- Safety: RFID + B4UFly -> Risk assessments
- Data integration:
- BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight): Regulations easing
#### 4. How does one *learn* about drones effectively in 2025?

- AI
	- AI helps for concepts
	- Helps with writing code (no vibe coding)
- Experience
- Engage in open-ended projects
- Reach out
